# Phylogenetic Analysis of mecA Antibiotic Resistance Gene

## Overview
This project involves a gene-based phylogenetic analysis of the **mecA antibiotic resistance gene** across different *Staphylococcus* species. The study aims to understand the evolutionary conservation and divergence of mecA, which plays a key role in methicillin resistance, using multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction.

## Tools Used
- NCBI Nucleotide Database  
- MEGA 12  
- ClustalW  
- MUSCLE  

---

## Dataset
- Gene: mecA (partial coding sequences)  
- Organisms: *Staphylococcus* species  
- Sequence type: DNA (annotated partial CDS)  

---

## Methodology
1. Retrieval of mecA gene sequences from the NCBI database  
2. Selection of annotated and reliable partial CDS with overlapping regions  
3. Multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW/MUSCLE in MEGA  
4. Manual trimming of non-overlapping regions  
5. Phylogenetic tree construction using the Neighbor-Joining method  
6. Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications  

---

## Results
- mecA gene sequences showed high sequence conservation across *Staphylococcus* species  
- Minor nucleotide variations indicated species-specific divergence  
- The phylogenetic tree revealed close clustering of mecA sequences  
- Short branch lengths reflected strong evolutionary conservation  

---

## Conclusion
The phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the mecA gene is highly conserved among *Staphylococcus* species, suggesting a common evolutionary origin. This study highlights the usefulness of bioinformatics tools in understanding the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.
