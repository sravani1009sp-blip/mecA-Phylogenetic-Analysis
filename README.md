# mecA-Phylogenetic-Analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of mecA antibiotic resistance gene in Staphylococcus species using MEGA

Project Overview

Antibiotic resistance is a major global health concern, particularly resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in Staphylococcus species. The mecA gene plays a crucial role in methicillin resistance by encoding an altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a), allowing bacteria to survive antibiotic treatment.

This project uses bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis to study the evolutionary relationships of the mecA gene across different Staphylococcus species. By comparing gene sequences and constructing a phylogenetic tree, the project highlights the conservation and divergence of this important resistance determinant.

Objectives

Retrieve mecA gene sequences from public databases

Perform multiple sequence alignment of mecA sequences

Construct a phylogenetic tree to study evolutionary relationships

Interpret conservation and divergence of the mecA gene

Dataset

Gene analyzed: mecA (partial coding sequences)

Organisms: Multiple Staphylococcus species

Data source: NCBI Nucleotide Database

Sequence type: DNA (annotated partial CDS with overlapping regions)

 Tools & Software Used

NCBI – Sequence retrieval

MEGA 12 – Alignment and phylogenetic analysis

ClustalW / MUSCLE – Multiple sequence alignment

Methodology

mecA gene sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database.

Only annotated and reliable partial CDS sequences were selected.

Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW/MUSCLE in MEGA.

Non-overlapping regions were manually trimmed to ensure alignment quality.

A Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using the p-distance model.

Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications was used to test tree reliability.

Results

The mecA gene showed high sequence conservation across Staphylococcus species.

Minor nucleotide variations indicated species-specific divergence.

The phylogenetic tree revealed close clustering, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.

Short branch lengths reflected the functional importance of mecA in antibiotic resistance.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the mecA gene is a highly conserved antibiotic resistance determinant among Staphylococcus species. Phylogenetic analysis provides valuable insights into the evolutionary stability and dissemination of resistance genes, emphasizing the role of bioinformatics in antimicrobial resistance research.
